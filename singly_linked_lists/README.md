# C - Singly linked lists

This project focuses on implementing and understanding the concept of singly linked lists in the C programming language. By completing this project, you will gain insights into the use of linked lists versus arrays, as well as how to build and manipulate linked lists.
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external sources:

When and why to use linked lists instead of arrays.
How to construct and utilize linked lists.
